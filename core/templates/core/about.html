<h1>About getJustice</h1>
<h2>
getJustice combines social media and social activism to 
allow users to report cases of injustice they see online to 
civil rights organizations and their local representatives quickly 
and securely. Our goal is to increase police accountability, 
decrease the length of time it takes for an instance of injustice 
to be seen on social media before a suspect is charged with a crime, 
and foster a new generation of political activists by providing millenials
with easy access to activate their political power.
