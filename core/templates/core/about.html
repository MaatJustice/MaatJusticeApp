<strong>getJustice<strong> 
How often do we see an instance of injustice on social media and feel disturbed, angry and helpless?

We are getJustice want to change that. We are combining social activism and social media to instantly allow users to report cases of hate crime, police brutality and injustice they see online to the elected representatives, the civilian police review board and civil rights groups.

Our goal is to increase police accountability, repair officer relations with their communities and decrease the length of time it takes between an instance of injustice beign seen on social media and a suspect is charged with a crime. We wish to bring pressure by collective action on the police and other authorities to respond quickly and act proactively to end such instances.</p>
